        "## Tracking a single target in the presence of clutter and missed detections\n\nTracking is frequently complicated by the presence of detections which are not\nassociated with the target of interest. These may range from sensor-generated noise to\nreturns off intervening physical objects, or environmental effects. We refer to these\ncollectively as *clutter* if they have only nuisance value and need to be filtered out.\n\nIn this tutorial we introduce the use of data association algorithms in Stone Soup and\ndemonstrate how they can mitigate confusion due to clutter. To begin with we use a\n**nearest neighbour** method, which is conceptually simple and associates a prediction and a\ndetection based only on their proximity as quantified by a particular metric.\n\n\n"

        "## Background\nThe principal difficulty in practical multi-object tracking is not usually to do with the state\nof an individual object. Rather it is to do with the fact that the potential association of\nmeasurement to prediction is fraught with ambiguity. To illustrate this point consider a couple\nof examples:\n\n<img src=\"https://stonesoup.rtfd.io/en/latest/_static/20170705_2x2associationexamples.png\" width=\"300\" alt=\"Exahustive enumeration of associations of 2 targets to 2 measurements\">\n\n<img src=\"https://stonesoup.rtfd.io/en/latest/_static/800px-20170607_associations.png\" width=\"300\" alt=\"Number of potential associations of measurements to targets\">\n\nThe first (left) is the full set of associations of two targets (crosses) with two\nmeasurements (stars). Green: measurement generated by one target only and target capable of\ngenerating one measurement only; Yellow: includes measurements generated by more than one target;\nPink: includes targets generating more than one measurement. The second image (right) shows the\nnumber of ways of associating up to 5 targets with up to 10 measurements depending on whether you\nallow one-to-one (bottom), many-to-one (middle) or many-to-many (top). In this latter instance\nthe number of potential associations *at a single time instance* tops out at $10^{15}$\n\nClearly it would be prohibitive to have to assess each of these options at each timestep. For\nthis reason there exist a number of data association schemes. We'll set up a scenario and then\nproceed to introduce the nearest neighbour algorithm as a first means to address the association\nissue.\n\n"
