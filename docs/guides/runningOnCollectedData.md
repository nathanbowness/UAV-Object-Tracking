# Running on previously collected data

To run the `tracking.py` program on previously recorded data, there are 2 options:

1. Pass the CLI arguments to the program with required details.
2. Mount configuration files for Radar and/or Video processing with required details.

!!! note
    All options below, will assume you have pulled the docker image, and tagged it as `tracking-image` to simplify the following commands (so they're not platform dependant). Please see the [docker quickstart](./runningInDocker.md) section for more details.

## 1. Using CLI Arguments to Run on Collected Data



## 2. Mounting and Changing Configuration Files
